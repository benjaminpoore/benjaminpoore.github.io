                <h2>3) Persona</h2>
                <h3>Key Persona: The Caring Mother, Wife</h3>

                <p>Nicole Colleen is a thirty-eight-year-old wife and mother. She has a husband, who often travels for work, and three children who enjoy the outdoors. Her family often goes camping and it can sometimes be stressful for Nicole to not know what the weather might be on their trip. She also worries about her husband and his travel to and from different states during his work assignments.</p>

                <p>If she hears about a storm near where her husband is traveling, she takes it upon herself to make sure she finds out more about it and then relays the information to him so he can be safe while traveling. When it's wintertime and she wants to take the kids to the ski resort, she must travel over an hour to get there. Before leaving, she needs to reassure herself that it's going to be a good day for skiing and that the roads are safe for winter travel.</p>

                <p>Nicole needs to have an easy way to access weather information no matter where she is, or what device she is using. She is tired of weather websites that are confusing and cluttered, she just wants the basic information that matters so she can calm her stress when caring for her family.</p>
